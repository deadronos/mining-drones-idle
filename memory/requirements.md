# Requirements

## RQ-001 Core Economy Tick

WHEN the simulation advances by a fixed timestep, THE SYSTEM SHALL convert available ore into bars at a 10:1 ratio modified by refinery level and prestige bonus. [Acceptance: Unit test validates tick math for multiple module levels.]

## RQ-002 Drone Fleet Scaling

WHEN the player purchases additional drone bay modules, THE SYSTEM SHALL adjust the active drone count within one second to match the module level minimum of one drone. [Acceptance: Unit or integration test confirms drone count change after upgrade.]

## RQ-003 Asteroid Richness Scaling

WHEN the scanner module level increases, THE SYSTEM SHALL spawn future asteroids with an increased average ore richness proportional to the scanner bonus. [Acceptance: Unit test measures richness mean rising with level.]

## RQ-004 UI Feedback Loop

WHEN resources change due to simulation or actions, THE SYSTEM SHALL update HUD and upgrade panel values within the next frame. [Acceptance: Playwright test verifies ore accrual and upgrade availability.]

## RQ-005 Prestige Reset

WHEN the player activates prestige with required bars, THE SYSTEM SHALL grant permanent cores based on bars held, reset run resources, and preserve prestige bonus function. [Acceptance: Unit test verifies prestige gain and reset behavior.]
