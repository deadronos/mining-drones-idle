# Project Brief

## Vision

A 3D idle/incremental web game where players oversee an orbital factory that deploys autonomous drones to mine asteroids, refine ore, and unlock new modules and technologies.

## Goals

- Deliver a playable MVP with foundational economy, drone simulation, and upgrade/prestige systems.
- Showcase 3D scene using React Three Fiber with readable resource HUD and upgrade panel.
- Support idle progression including offline catch-up scaffolding.

## Scope

- Single-page web application built with React, Zustand, and Miniplex.
- Core loop: drones mine ore, ore refines into bars, modules unlock with resources, prestige for permanent bonuses.
- Provide automated tests (Vitest, Playwright) validating economy and boot flow.

## Out of Scope

- Multiplayer or networked gameplay.
- Complex graphics beyond instanced low-poly meshes and simple effects.
- Advanced automation scripting beyond placeholder hooks.
