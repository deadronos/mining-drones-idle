# Active Context

## Current Focus

Advance TASK002 by unifying refinery processing between live ECS ticks and offline catch-up while capturing telemetry for later balancing work.

## Recent Changes

- Ensured the refinery ECS system now delegates directly to the store's `processRefinery` method for identical live/offline behavior.
- Refactored offline simulation to call store actions in fixed steps and return telemetry about ore consumption and bar production.
- Added persistence logging for offline catch-up runs to aid balancing and regression debugging.
- Expanded the implementation plan with an error handling matrix and unit testing roadmap to guide upcoming milestones.

## Next Steps

- Monitor telemetry from offline recap sessions to ensure refinery parity holds under varied saves.
- Outline follow-up work for energy throttling and per-drone batteries once refinery parity remains stable.
- Capture any manual QA findings from extended offline catch-up runs and feed them into the upcoming energy milestone planning.
- Feed the new error handling/test strategy into Milestone 1 execution notes and update task breakdowns accordingly.
