# Active Context

## Current Focus

Stabilize the new per-drone energy systems and seeded RNG pipeline from TASK006/TASK007, and prepare UI follow-ups for battery HUD feedback.

## Recent Changes

- Introduced per-drone battery fields, travel/mining throttling, and charging allocation with new unit coverage.
- Added deterministic RNG utility, updated world generation to consume seeded randomness, and expanded tests/README accordingly.
- Maintained persistence hooks so RNG seeds and energy settings continue to roundtrip through snapshots.

## Next Steps

- Monitor simulation telemetry to validate long-run battery balance and identify UI indicators needed for individual drones.
- Plan HUD work to surface average/low battery warnings and evaluate Settings copy for throttle floor guidance.
- Review RNG integration with save import/export flows and scope any reset/regeneration hooks needed for world rebuilds.
