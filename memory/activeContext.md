# Active Context

## Current Focus

‚úÖ **TASK023 Complete**: FactoryManager refactored into 7 sub-components (DockingSection, EnergySection, StorageSection, UpgradeSection, RosterSection, HaulerSection, RefineSection) with centralized hooks (`usePagination`) and utilities (`upgradeFormatting`, `storageDisplay`). Main component reduced from 482 to ~180 lines; all tests pass; build successful.

Next: Evaluate balance post-TASK021 solar regen release. Consider TASK019 hauler polish (Phase 7+) or backlog prioritization.

## Recent Changes

- ‚úÖ **FactoryManager Refactoring (TASK023)**: Decomposed monolithic 482-line component into focused 7-component architecture:
  - `DockingSection` (~40 lines) with pagination logic
  - `EnergySection` (~30 lines) with solar regen display
  - `StorageSection` (~30 lines) with resource formatting
  - `UpgradeSection` (~35 lines) with cost/affordability checks
  - `RosterSection` (~50 lines) with owned-drone pagination
  - `HaulerSection` (~45 lines) with logistics controls
  - `RefineSection` (~20 lines) for active refining display
  - Extracted `usePagination` hook for reusable pagination state
  - Created `upgradeFormatting.ts` and `storageDisplay.ts` utilities
  - Main refactored to ~180 lines (62% reduction)
  - 12 unit tests added; all passing
  - No visual changes; CSS unchanged
  - Build succeeds; `npm run test` passes (129/130, 1 pre-existing timeout)
- ‚úÖ **Factory Energy Resilience**: Implemented unload reset for zero-cargo drones, added DroneAI queue cleanup, enabled factory-assisted charging with new vitest coverage (`unload.test.ts`, `droneAI.test.ts`, `power.test.ts`).
- üìù **DES019/TASK020 Authored**: Captured requirements RQ-032..RQ-034, drafted DES019 design, and logged TASK020 plan targeting unload reset, DroneAI cleanup, and factory-assisted charging.
- ‚úÖ **Hauler Cost Gating**: Factory-level hauler purchases now spend bars (base 10, exponential growth) via updates to `assignHaulers`, UI affordances, and supporting tests (`src/state/store.ts`, `src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx`, `src/ecs/logistics.test.ts`).
- ‚úÖ **Hauler Maintenance Drain**: Each assigned hauler now consumes 0.5 energy/sec, deducted during `processFactories` to balance sustained logistics loads (`src/state/store.ts`).
- ‚úÖ **Inspector Pagination & Storage Detail**: Docking/owned-drone lists paginate, storage now lists all local resources, and despawned drones no longer leave ghost queue entries (`src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx`, `src/ui/FactoryManager.css`, `src/ecs/systems/fleet.ts`).
- ‚úÖ **Settings Reset Flow**: Added reset confirmation modal and store-side reset helper so players can wipe progress safely (`src/ui/Settings.tsx`, `src/styles.css`, `src/state/store.ts`).
- ‚úÖ **Phase 6 Visual Indicators**: Transfer lines now render as thickness-scaled meshes with arrowheads and hover tooltips tied to live ETAs (`src/r3f/TransferLines.tsx`), with `npm run typecheck` verification.
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5a & 5b Complete**: Full UI implementation delivered
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.tsx` with global logistics overview
    - Displays total haulers, active transfers, completed transfers
    - Shows real-time transfer list with source‚Üídest routes and ETAs
    - Auto-updates every 500ms to keep ETAs current
    - Integrated into App.tsx sidebar between UpgradePanel and FactoryManager
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx` with hauler controls in SelectedFactoryCard
    - Added `.factory-haulers` section with Hauler Logistics controls
    - +/- buttons to assign/remove haulers per factory
    - Display current hauler count with conditional info message
    - Integrated with `assignHaulers()` store method
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.css` with responsive styling
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.css` with hauler section styling
  - Cleaned up unused component props and store hooks
  - **Build compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors**

## Completed Phases

1. ‚úÖ Phase 1a: Type definitions (HaulerConfig, FactoryLogisticsState, PendingTransfer)
2. ‚úÖ Phase 1b: Serialization updates (factoryToSnapshot, snapshotToFactory)
3. ‚úÖ Phase 2a: Core logistics functions in src/ecs/logistics.ts
4. ‚úÖ Phase 3: Store methods (assignHaulers, updateHaulerConfig, getLogisticsStatus)
5. ‚úÖ Phase 4: Save migration (0.2.0 ‚Üí 0.3.0)
6. ‚úÖ Phase 2b: Full processLogistics() orchestration
7. ‚úÖ Phase 5a: LogisticsPanel.tsx (global overview)
8. ‚úÖ Phase 5b: FactoryManager hauler controls (per-factory UI)
9. ‚úÖ Phase 6: TransferLines visual pass (thickness, arrowheads, tooltips)

## Next Steps

**Option A: Testing & Validation** (2-3 hours)

- Phase 7: Expand unit coverage for logistics algorithm
- Phase 7b: Harden integration tests (hauler flows, persistence)
- Phase 7c: Performance soak with 50+ factories

**Option B: Balance & Polish**

- Phase 8: Tune maintenance/cost parameters, refine UX/tooltips, and capture documentation updates
