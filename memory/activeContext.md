# Active Context

## Current Focus

Execute TASK019 (Hauler Logistics Implementation Phase 5 Complete): UI components created and integrated - LogisticsPanel provides global overview, FactoryManager extended with hauler controls.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Phase 5a & 5b Complete**: Full UI implementation delivered
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.tsx` with global logistics overview
    - Displays total haulers, active transfers, completed transfers
    - Shows real-time transfer list with source→dest routes and ETAs
    - Auto-updates every 500ms to keep ETAs current
    - Integrated into App.tsx sidebar between UpgradePanel and FactoryManager
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx` with hauler controls in SelectedFactoryCard
    - Added `.factory-haulers` section with Hauler Logistics controls
    - +/- buttons to assign/remove haulers per factory
    - Display current hauler count with conditional info message
    - Integrated with `assignHaulers()` store method
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.css` with responsive styling
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.css` with hauler section styling
  - Cleaned up unused component props and store hooks
  - **Build compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors**

## Completed Phases

1. ✅ Phase 1a: Type definitions (HaulerConfig, FactoryLogisticsState, PendingTransfer)
2. ✅ Phase 1b: Serialization updates (factoryToSnapshot, snapshotToFactory)
3. ✅ Phase 2a: Core logistics functions in src/ecs/logistics.ts
4. ✅ Phase 3: Store methods (assignHaulers, updateHaulerConfig, getLogisticsStatus)
5. ✅ Phase 4: Save migration (0.2.0 → 0.3.0)
6. ✅ Phase 2b: Full processLogistics() orchestration
7. ✅ Phase 5a: LogisticsPanel.tsx (global overview)
8. ✅ Phase 5b: FactoryManager hauler controls (per-factory UI)

## Next Steps

**Option A: Continue 3D Visualization** (2-3 hours)

- Phase 6a: Add transfer lines/arrows in 3D scene
- Phase 6b: Implement resource color coding and hover tooltips

**Option B: Add/Complete Tests** (2-3 hours)

- Phase 7: Write unit tests for logistics algorithm (partial done)
- Phase 7b: Write integration tests (partial done)
- Phase 7c: Performance testing with 50+ factories

### Option C: Balance & Polish

- Phase 8: Add hauler cost calculations, maintenance energy, parameter tuning
