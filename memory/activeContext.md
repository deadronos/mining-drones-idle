# Active Context

## Current Focus

Execute TASK019 (Hauler Logistics Implementation Phase 2b Complete): Implemented full processLogistics() orchestration to schedule and execute resource transfers between factories based on surplus/need matching.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Phase 2b Complete**: Full `processLogistics()` orchestration implemented in store.ts
  - Added logistics core function imports and TransportableResource type
  - Added `gameTime: number` field to track elapsed time in seconds
  - Updated `tick()` to increment gameTime before processing
  - Scheduler throttled to 2-second intervals to reduce overhead
  - Implements full matching loop: surplus→need, reservations, scheduling, arrivals, cleanup
  - Updated `PendingTransfer` interface with proper type safety
  - **Code compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors**

## Completed Phases

1. ✅ Phase 1a: Type definitions (HaulerConfig, FactoryLogisticsState, PendingTransfer)
2. ✅ Phase 1b: Serialization updates (factoryToSnapshot, snapshotToFactory)
3. ✅ Phase 2a: Core logistics functions in src/ecs/logistics.ts
4. ✅ Phase 3: Store methods (assignHaulers, updateHaulerConfig, getLogisticsStatus)
5. ✅ Phase 4: Save migration (0.2.0 → 0.3.0)
6. ✅ Phase 2b: Full processLogistics() orchestration

## Next Steps

**Option A: Continue UI Implementation** (2-3 hours)
- Phase 5a: Create LogisticsPanel.tsx component
- Phase 5b: Extend FactoryInspector with hauler controls

**Option B: Add Tests** (2-3 hours)
- Phase 7: Write unit tests for logistics algorithm

### Option C: Continue Tomorrow

- All foundational work complete; system is operational
- UI/testing can proceed independently
