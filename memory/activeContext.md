# Active Context

## Current Focus

Execute TASK018 (Desktop Responsive HUD & Panels): introduce fluid typography, clamped panel widths, and scrollable sidebars so the existing desktop UI scales without overflow.

## Recent Changes

- Captured responsive requirements RQ-029 through RQ-031.
- Authored DES017 outlining CSS variable strategy and desktop-only scope with future mobile considerations.
- Created TASK018 implementation plan covering global styles and FactoryManager adjustments.

## Next Steps

1. Update `src/styles.css` with fluid scaling variables, sidebar constraints, and breakpoint tweaks per DES017.
2. Refresh `src/ui/FactoryManager.css` to reference the shared typography/spacing variables.
3. Manually verify layout behaviour at 960pxâ€“1920px widths and ~720px height, then run lint/typecheck/tests.
4. Log future mobile/tab layout ideas in docs for follow-up.
