# Active Context

## Current Focus

Execute TASK019 (Hauler Logistics Implementation) — Phase 6 visuals landed; prepping validation/polish follow-up after integrating 3D transfer cues.

## Recent Changes

- ✅ **Hauler Cost Gating**: Factory-level hauler purchases now spend bars (base 10, exponential growth) via updates to `assignHaulers`, UI affordances, and supporting tests (`src/state/store.ts`, `src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx`, `src/ecs/logistics.test.ts`).
- ✅ **Hauler Maintenance Drain**: Each assigned hauler now consumes 0.5 energy/sec, deducted during `processFactories` to balance sustained logistics loads (`src/state/store.ts`).
- ✅ **Inspector Pagination & Storage Detail**: Docking/owned-drone lists paginate, storage now lists all local resources, and despawned drones no longer leave ghost queue entries (`src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx`, `src/ui/FactoryManager.css`, `src/ecs/systems/fleet.ts`).
- ✅ **Phase 6 Visual Indicators**: Transfer lines now render as thickness-scaled meshes with arrowheads and hover tooltips tied to live ETAs (`src/r3f/TransferLines.tsx`), with `npm run typecheck` verification.
- ✅ **Phase 5a & 5b Complete**: Full UI implementation delivered
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.tsx` with global logistics overview
    - Displays total haulers, active transfers, completed transfers
    - Shows real-time transfer list with source→dest routes and ETAs
    - Auto-updates every 500ms to keep ETAs current
    - Integrated into App.tsx sidebar between UpgradePanel and FactoryManager
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.tsx` with hauler controls in SelectedFactoryCard
    - Added `.factory-haulers` section with Hauler Logistics controls
    - +/- buttons to assign/remove haulers per factory
    - Display current hauler count with conditional info message
    - Integrated with `assignHaulers()` store method
  - Created `src/ui/LogisticsPanel.css` with responsive styling
  - Extended `src/ui/FactoryManager.css` with hauler section styling
  - Cleaned up unused component props and store hooks
  - **Build compiles successfully with no TypeScript errors**

## Completed Phases

1. ✅ Phase 1a: Type definitions (HaulerConfig, FactoryLogisticsState, PendingTransfer)
2. ✅ Phase 1b: Serialization updates (factoryToSnapshot, snapshotToFactory)
3. ✅ Phase 2a: Core logistics functions in src/ecs/logistics.ts
4. ✅ Phase 3: Store methods (assignHaulers, updateHaulerConfig, getLogisticsStatus)
5. ✅ Phase 4: Save migration (0.2.0 → 0.3.0)
6. ✅ Phase 2b: Full processLogistics() orchestration
7. ✅ Phase 5a: LogisticsPanel.tsx (global overview)
8. ✅ Phase 5b: FactoryManager hauler controls (per-factory UI)
9. ✅ Phase 6: TransferLines visual pass (thickness, arrowheads, tooltips)

## Next Steps

**Option A: Testing & Validation** (2-3 hours)

- Phase 7: Expand unit coverage for logistics algorithm
- Phase 7b: Harden integration tests (hauler flows, persistence)
- Phase 7c: Performance soak with 50+ factories

**Option B: Balance & Polish**

- Phase 8: Tune maintenance/cost parameters, refine UX/tooltips, and capture documentation updates
