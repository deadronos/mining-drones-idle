# Product Context

## Problem Statement

Space Factory aims to satisfy players seeking a relaxed yet systems-rich idle experience with compelling 3D visuals. Existing idle games often lack spatial feedback; this project pairs orbital mining fiction with resource management depth.

## Target Users

- Idle/incremental game enthusiasts who enjoy optimizing resource flows.
- Casual players interested in sci-fi themes and autonomous simulation.

## Key Features

- Autonomous drones mining asteroids and returning resources.
- Refining pipelines converting ore into usable bars and components.
- Upgrade modules and prestige tech to scale throughput.
- Offline progress catch-up for idle-friendly pacing.

## Experience Goals

- Provide readable in-game metrics for ore, bars, energy, and upgrades.
- Maintain chill ambiance while delivering crunchy decision-making.
- Ensure players see immediate impact from upgrades (more drones, faster refining).
