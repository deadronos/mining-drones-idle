# TASK026 - Settings Panel Responsive Layout

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Design Reference:** [DES022: Settings Panel Responsive Layout](../designs/DES022-settings-panel-responsive.md)

## Original Request

Create a responsive Settings modal that uses multiple columns when space allows, clamps to the viewport without forcing the browser window to scroll, and only shows internal scrollbars when content truly overflows after scaling.

## Thought Process

The current Settings panel is a fixed-width column that can grow taller than the viewport, which causes the entire app to scroll behind the modal. On large monitors the narrow column wastes horizontal space, making dense controls feel stacked and inefficient. The redesign needs to leverage the responsive variables introduced in DES017 while keeping markup changes minimal for stability. CSS Grid is sufficient for adaptive columns; we only need to introduce a wrapper container and update CSS clamps. Accessibility must remain intact (dialog semantics, focus handling), and we should leave the confirmation overlay untouched.

## Implementation Plan

1. Wrap existing Settings sections in a `settings-content` grid container and tag primer copy with `settings-section--wide`.
2. Expand `.settings-panel` width clamps, add `max-height` tied to viewport, and enable internal scrolling with stable scrollbars.
3. Define grid styles for `.settings-content` with auto-fit columns, responsive breakpoints (<1024px single column), and column gaps.
4. Manually verify layout/scroll behavior at 900px, 1280px, 1440px, and 1920px widths plus a 720px height scenario.

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-24

- Task drafted from user request; awaiting implementation work.
- Implemented markup wrapper and section modifier in `src/ui/Settings.tsx` to enable grid placement.
- Expanded `.settings-panel` sizing, added grid styles, and responsive breakpoints in `src/styles.css` for multi-column layout and height clamping.
- Ran `npm test -- --runInBand` (Vitest suite) to confirm existing coverage still passes.
- Manually verified the dialog at 900px, 1280px, 1440px, and 1920px widths plus ~720px viewport height; internal scrollbars only appear when height is constrained.
