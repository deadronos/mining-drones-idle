# TASK003 â€” Spec Refresh for Current Implementation

## Status

In Progress

## Summary

Update `spec/spec-full-idea.md` so it mirrors the shipped MVP and persistence/offline utilities while flagging remaining roadmap work.

## Tasks

1. Review current ECS, store, persistence, and offline modules to capture factual behavior (DES002).
2. Rewrite spec sections (overview, goals, requirements, data model, systems, persistence/offline, UI/UX, acceptance criteria, roadmap, changelog) per DES002 table.
3. Ensure new requirements RQ-006 and RQ-007 are satisfied in the spec narrative (implemented vs. planned differentiation).
4. Update memory logs (progress) after spec changes.
5. Prepare PR summary referencing DES002 and TASK003.

## Dependencies

- Requires design DES002.

## Acceptance

- Spec contains persistence manager API details and clearly labels implemented vs. planned UI/systems.
- Memory bank updated (active context, requirements, tasks log, progress).

## Notes

- No code changes expected; documentation-only update.
