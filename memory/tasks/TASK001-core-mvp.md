# TASK001 - Core MVP Implementation

**Status:** Completed
**Added:** 2025-02-14
**Updated:** 2025-02-14

## Original Request

Implement the Space Factory MVP described in idea.md and idea-notes.md using the existing template repo, following the spec-driven workflow.

## Thought Process

Deliver foundational gameplay loop with deterministic simulation, resource economy, and upgrade/prestige UI. Use Zustand for store and Miniplex for ECS. Prioritize meeting file size constraints and ensuring tests cover requirements.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Setup & Dependencies**
   - Install `zustand`, `miniplex`, and `@playwright/test`.
   - Ensure project scripts remain intact.
2. **Directory & Base Files**
   - Create `src/` structure per idea-notes (state, ecs, r3f, ui, lib, styles).
   - Implement `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `Scene.tsx`, HUD overlay, and CSS.
3. **State Store**
   - Build `state/store.ts` with resources, modules, prestige, tick logic, and helper selectors.
   - Add unit tests validating economy, cost curve, prestige calculations.
4. **ECS World & Systems**
   - Create `ecs/world.ts` establishing entities and queries.
   - Implement systems: time accumulator, fleet, asteroids, droneAI, mining, travel, unload, refinery, power (stub where necessary but ensure core loop works).
   - Write targeted unit tests for fleet scaling and asteroid richness.
5. **Rendering Components**
   - Implement `r3f` components for asteroids, drones, factory.
   - Hook systems into `Scene.tsx` update loop.
6. **UI Components**
   - Build HUD display for resources and `UpgradePanel` with upgrade and prestige controls.
   - Ensure store interactions update UI promptly.
7. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create Playwright test verifying ore accrual and upgrade enabling.
   - Run lint, format check, type check, unit tests, e2e tests as per user instruction.
8. **Documentation & Cleanup**
   - Update Memory Bank progress and active context if necessary.
   - Prepare final summary and PR.

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
