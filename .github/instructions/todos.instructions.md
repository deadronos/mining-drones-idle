- [x] analyze-resources-and-propose-bonuses: Analyze current resource types (metals, crystals, organics, ice) and propose concrete bonuses and mechanics tying them into drones/refinery/energy systems. Produce formulas and example calculations for given sample values. ðŸ”´
  _Design how each resource maps to systems and a tiered/diminishing-return formula approach_
- [x] propose-formulas-and-balancing: Write specific scaling formulas (with caps/diminishing returns), provide numeric examples and suggested default constants for tuning. ðŸŸ¡
- [x] integration-and-files-to-change: List precise files/systems to modify, minimal components to add, and tests to write. ðŸŸ¡
- [x] create-memory-task-and-next-steps: Create a `memory/tasks` entry and a small implementation plan for follow-up work (PoC, tests, PR checklist). ðŸŸ¢
