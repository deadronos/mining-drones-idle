# TASK019: Hauler Logistics Implementation

- [x] 1: Phase 1a: Type definitions (HaulerConfig, FactoryLogisticsState, PendingTransfer) ðŸ”´
  _Added to store.ts; extends FactorySnapshot with hauler fields_
- [x] 2: Phase 1b: Serialization updates (factoryToSnapshot, snapshotToFactory, cloneFactory) ðŸ”´
  _All serialization functions now handle hauler state; deep copying working_
- [x] 3: Phase 2a: Create src/ecs/logistics.ts with core functions ðŸ”´
  _All functions implemented: matching, reservations, travel time, transfers_
- [x] 4: Phase 3: Add store methods (assignHaulers, updateHaulerConfig, getLogisticsStatus) ðŸ”´
  _Three methods added; processLogistics() hook added to tick() method_
- [x] 5: Phase 4: Implement save version migration (0.2.0 â†’ 0.3.0) ðŸ”´
  _applyMigrations() added; parseSnapshot() updated; backward compatible_
- [x] 6: Phase 2b: Implement full processLogistics() orchestration ðŸ”´
  _Full orchestration complete: scheduling loop, reservations, arrivals, cleanup. gameTime tracking added._
- [ ] 7: Phase 5a: Create LogisticsPanel.tsx UI (global overview) ðŸŸ¡
  _Shows hauler count, network throughput, bottleneck detection_
- [ ] 8: Phase 5b: Extend FactoryInspector with hauler controls ðŸŸ¡
  _Add +/- buttons, mode dropdown, resource filters, inbound/outbound display_
- [ ] 9: Phase 6: Add 3D transfer line visualizations between factories ðŸŸ¢
  _Visual feedback for active shipments; helps debug network_
- [ ] 10: Phase 7: Write unit tests for logistics algorithm ðŸŸ¡
  _Test matching, reservations, min reserve, conservation of resources_
- [ ] 11: Phase 8: Balance tuning and cost/maintenance mechanics ðŸŸ¢
  _Set maintenance costs, speed modifiers, capacity tiers based on playtesting_
